I'LL SMILE
I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO FOOL THIS TOWN
I'LL DO IT 'TIL THE SUN GOES DOWN
AND ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT TIME
OH YEAH I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR
KEEP MY SUNGLASSES ON
WHILE I SHED A TEAR
IT'S NEVER THE RIGHT TIME
I'LL PUT MY ARMOR ON
SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM
I'LL PUT MY ARMOR ON
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT I AM
CHORUS
I'M UNSTOPPABLE
I'M A PORSCHE WITH NO BRAKES
I'M INVINCIBLE
YES I'LL WIN EVERY SINGLE GAME
I'M SO POWERFUL
I DON'T NEED BATTERIES TO PLAY
I'M SO CONFIDENT
I'M UNSTOPPABLE TODAY
UNSTOPPABLE TODAY
I BREAK DOWN
ONLY ALONE I WILL CRY OUT LOUD
YOU'LL NEVER SEE WHAT'S HIDING OUT
HIDING OUT DEEP DOWN
I KNOW I'VE HEARD THAT
TO LET YOUR FEELINGS SHOW
IS THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE FRIENDSHIPS GROW
BUT I'M TOO AFRAID NOW
I'LL PUT MY ARMOR ON
SHOW YOU HOW STRONG I AM
I'LL PUT MY ARMOR ON
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT I AM
CHORUS
